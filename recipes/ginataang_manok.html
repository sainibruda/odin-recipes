    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This ginataang manok is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk. Each family has their own
        version; this is my mother's. It's a rich dish that makes your kitchen smell so wonderful! Once my family smells
        the ginger frying and coconut milk simmering, they can't wait for it to be done so they can dig in. I salt it
        liberally, as the coconut milk tends to hide the salt flavor.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sliced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 (5 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and stir in ginger. Cook and stir until fragrant and lightly
            browned. Remove ginger and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken in the same skillet over medium-high heat without
            crowding. Cook until chicken is lightly brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Return ginger to the skillet and add coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then cover with the lid tilted to allow
            steam to escape. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer
            pink at the bone, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in spinach and simmer uncovered until spinach is warmed through, 8 to 12 minutes. Season with salt and
            pepper.</li>
    </ol>
